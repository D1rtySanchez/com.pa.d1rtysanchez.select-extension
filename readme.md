Select hotkeys, aimed to streamline the controls for less camera navigation.

[b]Example #1:[/b] early legion spy network - use "select all idle scouts" followed by "select single closest" and pick a target, repeat for 5-6 targets to queue huge radar coverage in seconds.

[b]Example #2:[/b] "select all fabbers" followed by "select single closest", to queue a small build order without having to move your camera.
Repeat that to split few small build orders for (apm) speed, risk management, and aggressive expansion in multiple directions.

[b]Setup:[/b] Customize your hotkeys via settings->keyboard->Selex

----------------------

[b]Select Single Closest[/b]
Select the closest unit from current selection, Especially useful for fabbers & scouts.
Recommended to use "Select all idle fabbers/scouts" with this, that way you can keep the camera focused on your target, I personally bind this to [q]

[b]Select all Idle Fabbers[/b]
Select all idle fabbers on planet, checks zoom level to separate normal fabbers from orbital fabbers.

[b]Select all Idle Scouts[/b]
Selects all idle scouts, very useful for Legion faction investigator push.

[b]Select all Radars[/b]
Selects all radars, for checking radar coverage. This works as a toggle so you can quickly check your radar coverage.
Checks zoom level to separate ground radars from orbital radars.

[b]Select all Siege[/b] - Siege units are long range units like the mobile artillery.
[b]Select all Support[/b] - Support is for both siege & AA
